        keys:check
          Purpose:
            Validate API credentials by fetching representative market data. Useful when
            onboarding a new venue or verifying trading permissions.
          Key flags:
            --venue TEXT   Exchange to query (default: alpaca). Use --venue kraken for CCXT.
          Usage tips:
            - Run this before live trading to confirm read/trade permissions.
            - Combine with environment variable overrides to test sandbox keys.
          Sample output:

        fitness
          Purpose:
            Monitor bid/ask spreads and triangle candidates without placing orders.
            Ideal for validating venue connectivity and discovering profitable loops.
          Key flags:
            --venue TEXT              Exchange to query (default: alpaca).
            --secs INTEGER            Seconds to run (default: 20).
            --simulate/--no-simulate  Attempt dry-run triangle executions (default: no).
            --persist/--no-persist    Persist simulated fills to SQLite (with --simulate).
            --dummy-trigger           Inject a synthetic profitable triangle for testing.
            --symbols TEXT            CSV of legs to restrict monitored triangles.
            --discord-heartbeat-secs  Emit periodic Discord summaries (0 disables).
          Usage tips:
            - ``--simulate`` logs net% and PnL estimates; pair with ``--persist`` to audit later.
            - ``--dummy-trigger`` is helpful for end-to-end alerting/metrics rehearsals.
            - Pass ``--symbols 'ETH/USDT,BTC/USDT,ETH/BTC'`` to restrict to familiar legs.
            - Discord heartbeats summarize attempts/successes for remote monitoring.
          Sample log lines:
            kraken ETH/USDT spread=0.5 bps
            kraken [sim] Triangle(ETH/USDT, ETH/BTC, BTC/USDT) net=0.15% PnL=0.05 USDT

        live
          Purpose:
            Continuously evaluate live triangles and place orders when the net spread beats
            configured thresholds. Intended for production once fitness results look healthy.
          Key flags:
            --venues TEXT         CSV list of venues to trade concurrently (overrides --venue).
            --venue TEXT           Single venue fallback when --venues is omitted (default: alpaca).

            --attempt-notify       Send Discord updates on every attempt (noisy, opt-in).
          Usage tips:
            - ``--venues`` overrides ``--venue`` and spins up a loop per venue.
            - Confirm balances via the startup banner before trusting executions.
            - ``--symbols`` keeps exposure constrained to pairs you actively monitor.
            - ``--auto-suggest-top`` is useful for quick experiments; persists only for session.
            - Combine with metrics on port 9109 to track cycle latency and realized profit.
          Sample log lines:

          Key flags:
            --venue TEXT   Exchange to query (default: alpaca).
            --symbols TEXT CSV of symbols to filter (defaults to configured triangle legs).
          Usage tips:
            - Use alongside fitness metrics to correlate spreads versus fee drag.
            - Export results to a spreadsheet for per-symbol what-if analysis.

            --venue TEXT  Exchange to analyze (default: alpaca).
          Usage tips:
            - Treat as a baseline; tune thresholds according to venue-specific slippage.
            - Pair with ``markets:limits`` output to ensure size recommendations clear minimums.

            Useful for gauging latency penalties or cross-exchange arbitrage headroom.
          Key flags:
            --legs TEXT     CSV of legs (default: ETH/USDT,ETH/BTC,BTC/USDT).
            --venues TEXT   CSV mapping leg=venue (e.g., ETH/USDT=kraken,...).
            --secs INTEGER  Seconds to sample (default: 10).
          Usage tips:
            - Keep expectations modest; liquidity and settlement risk grow across venues.
            - Pair with ``markets:limits`` to ensure proposed legs exist on target venues.

            --env-path TEXT  Location of the .env file (default: .env).
          Usage tips:
            - Capture output under version control to document venue coverage drift.
            - Use ``--write-env`` during onboarding to scaffold configuration quickly.
